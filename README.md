# Personal Homelab

This repository documents my **personal homelab setup**, running on **Hyper-V** with **Ubuntu Server** as the host OS.  

I use **CasaOS** to manage Docker containers for a variety of services, including:

- **Media Servers** – Stream and manage media across devices.  
- **Home Automation** – Automate smart home devices and routines.  
- **Network & Device Monitoring** – Track system performance, uptime, and network activity.  
- **CCTV/Surveillance Monitoring** – Centralized security camera management and monitoring.  

This setup is designed for **remote management, expandability, and experimentation**, serving as both a learning environment and a fully functional home server.
